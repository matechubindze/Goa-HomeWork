        <h1 style="color: beige;">About Programming</h1>
    <p style="font-size: 10px; color: red;">Programming is the mental process of thinking up instructions to give to a machine (like a computer). Coding is the process of transforming those ideas into a written language that a computer can understand.</p>
    <h2 style="color: bisque;">History</h2>
    <p style="font-size: 20px; color: red;">Programmable devices have existed for centuries. As early as the 9th century, a programmable music sequencer was invented by the Persian Banu Musa brothers, who described an automated mechanical flute player in the Book of Ingenious Devices.[3][4] In 1206, the Arab engineer Al-Jazari invented a programmable drum machine where a musical mechanical automaton could be made to play different rhythms and drum patterns, via pegs and cams.[5][6] In 1801, the Jacquard loom could produce entirely different weaves by changing the "program" – a series of pasteboard cards with holes punched in them.

    Code-breaking algorithms have also existed for centuries. In the 9th century, the Arab mathematician Al-Kindi described a cryptographic algorithm for deciphering encrypted code, in A Manuscript on Deciphering Cryptographic Messages. He gave the first description of cryptanalysis by frequency analysis, the earliest code-breaking algorithm.[7]
    
    The first computer program is generally dated to 1843 when mathematician Ada Lovelace published an algorithm to calculate a sequence of Bernoulli numbers, intended to be carried out by Charles Babbage's Analytical Engine.[8] However, Charles Babbage himself had written a program for the AE in 1837.[9][10]
    
    
    Data and instructions were once stored on external punched cards, which were kept in order and arranged in program decks.
    In the 1880s, Herman Hollerith invented the concept of storing data in machine-readable form.[11] Later a control panel (plug board) added to his 1906 Type I Tabulator allowed it to be programmed for different jobs, and by the late 1940s, unit record equipment such as the IBM 602 and IBM 604, were programmed by control panels in a similar way, as were the first electronic computers. However, with the concept of the stored-program computer introduced in 1949, both programs and data were stored and manipulated in the same way in computer memory.[12]</p>
        <h2 style="color: bisque;">Machine language</h2>
      <p style="font-size: 20px; color: red;">Machine code was the language of early programs, written in the instruction set of the particular machine, often in binary notation. Assembly languages were soon developed that let the programmer specify instructions in a text format (e.g., ADD X, TOTAL), with abbreviations for each operation code and meaningful names for specifying addresses. However, because an assembly language is little more than a different notation for a machine language, two machines with different instruction sets also have different assembly languages.</p>
      <h2 style="color: bisque;">Compiler language</h2>
      <p style="font-size: 20px; color: red;">High-level languages made the process of developing a program simpler and more understandable, and less bound to the underlying hardware. The first compiler related tool, the A-0 System, was developed in 1952[13] by Grace Hopper, who also coined the term 'compiler'.[14][15] FORTRAN, the first widely used high-level language to have a functional implementation, came out in 1957,[16] and many other languages were soon developed—in particular, COBOL aimed at commercial data processing, and Lisp for computer research.
        These compiled languages allow the programmer to write programs in terms that are syntactically richer, and more capable of abstracting the code, making it easy to target varying machine instruction sets via compilation declarations and heuristics. Compilers harnessed the power of computers to make programming easier[16] by allowing programmers to specify calculations by entering a formula using infix notation.</p>
